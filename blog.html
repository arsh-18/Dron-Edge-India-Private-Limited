                    <h4>Infrastructure & Team</h4>
                    <p>An optical fiber cable is a type of cable that has a number of optical fibers bundled together, which are normally covered in their individual protective plastic covers. Optical cables are used to transfer digital data signals in the form of light up to distances of hundreds of miles with higher throughput rates than those achievable via electrical communication cables. All optical fibers use a core of hair-like transparent silicon covered with less refractive indexed cladding to avoid light leakage to the surroundings. Due to the extreme sensitivity of the optical fiber, it is normally covered with a high-strength, lightweight protective material like Kevlar. Optical fiber cable is widely used in fiber optic communications.</p>

                    <h4>Infrastructure Facilities</h4>
                    <p>India optical fiber cables (OFC) market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 17% through 2023. Growth in the market is majorly expected to be backed by rising investments in OFC network infrastructure by the Indian government to increase internet penetration across the country, which is in line with the government’s initiatives such as Smart Cities Vision and Digital India. Moreover, growing demand for OFC from IT & telecom sector, rising number of mobile devices, increasing adoption of FTTH (Fiber to the Home) connectivity and surging number of data centers is anticipated to fuel optical fiber cables market in India over the coming years.</p>

                    <h4>Logistics and Transportation</h4>
                    <p>Logistics and transportation are two very important parts of transportation and distribution services, and they are different. Transportation is the movement of goods and logistics is the management of the inward and outward transportation of goods from the manufacturer to the end user. These terms are often used interchangeably, but they are two extremely different part of the supply chain. Logistics and transportation deals with getting products and services from one location to another. Although logistics and transportation are used interchangeability, the differences are simply logistics deals with the integration of storage, transportation, cataloging, handling, and packaging of goods. Transportation deals with the function of moving products from one location to another.</p>
